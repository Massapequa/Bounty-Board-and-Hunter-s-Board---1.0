<summary>In this package:</summary>
Bounty Hunter Boards: Public boards that players interact with to get bounty contracts to kill high level monsters.

Bounty Spawners: Custom spawners that bounty boards use to create bounty lists. 
--Bounty spawners have easy-to-use timer options to allow customizable spawn windows for different creatures.
--Spawn windows can be in real time or in-game time. If the creatures are still alive outisde of the spawn window, they will be removed on the spawner's next "respawn" time, which can also be controlled through the spawner's timer menu.

Limitations of Bounty Boards: They are set up to create a contract for one specific Mobile, so if non-named creatures are added, it'll be difficult to find them.
as an exaple if you add "a troll" to list list, players wouldn't be able to tell which "troll" they needed to kill. However if you added "Tom the brigand", players could easily tell which brigand to kill.
This board was designed more for high level named monsters that take multiple players to take down. Multiple players can get credit for killing the same monster, to promote cooperation instead of competition.

Hunter's Board: A public board that allows for a broader range of creatures to added as bounties. 
-- Hunter's boards come with the added functionality of giving players a quantity of monsters to kill, such as "kill 10 harpies", etc.
-- Only the killer of the monster can get credit towards their hunter's contract.
